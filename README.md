<h2>Auto generated art gallery</h2>
<p>Every image added to the uploads folder automatically gets added to the webpage using the power of ExpressJS, Pug and the Node.js Fs.

Recently, auto-compression has been introduced. Every image is now compressed before the app is deployed. This helps both the visitors and the koyeb infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Running it locally</h2>

_Node.js and npm are required_

**1. Clone this repo using:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheEpicDragons/artwork.git
```

**2. Install dependancies:**
```sh
npm install
```

**3. Run the server:**
```sh
npm start
```

<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>Hosting is a major concern with a nodejs app. This app is super simple and can be hosted for free on serverless platforms. I use <a href="https://koyeb.com">Koyeb</a> to host it on a serverless environment.</p>
